- **VCF Filtering** â€“ Apply minimum depth filters and remove ambiguous sites.  
- **VCF Statistics** â€“ Get counts of homozygous/heterozygous SNPs, insertions, deletions.  
- **VCF Annotation** â€“ Annotate variants using reference FASTA and GFF3 feature records.  
- **FASTA Conversion** â€“ Generate per-sample FASTA consensus sequences from VCFs.  
- **VCF Merging** â€“ Combine multiple sample VCFs into one multi-sample merged VCF.  
- **FASTA Stats** â€“ Compute GC content, length, and ambiguous base counts.
